Code used to create a musical hoodie for CS 320, Tangible User Interfaces

The code for the temperature sensor originally came from: http://alysonfielding.com/?p=19

The code for BeatWrite oringinally came from: http://www.instructables.com/id/How-to-Make-LEDs-Flash-to-Music-with-an-Arduino/

We made minor modifications to the code in order to make it better suit our needs. Our changes are documented in the code.
